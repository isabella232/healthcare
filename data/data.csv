Can I keep my doctor?,"If you're shopping for a new policy on the insurance exchanges or are eligible for Medicaid, the answer is ""Maybe."" For private policies purchased through the exchange, it all depends on the list of doctors that the health plan considers 'in network.' If your doctor isn't in the plan's network, you'll likely pay a higher amount for co-insurance or copayment. The number of doctors who take Medicaid is growing in states where the program is being expanded, but the number of doctors who take Medicaid is still limited in most areas.","Exchanges,Basics",Exchanges,Basics,,"exchanges,basics"

So I have to get health insurance?,"Yes, just about everyone is required to have insurance as of Jan. 1, 2014, or else they'll be liable for a tax penalty.

What health services are covered?,"Each plan offered has to cover 10 ""essential health benefits."" These include prescription drugs, emergency and hospital care, doctor visits, maternity and mental health services, rehabilitation and lab services, among others. In addition, recommended preventive services, such as preventive mammograms, must be covered without any out-of-pocket costs to you. It's important to keep in mind that the insurer does <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/08/15/210481505/obamacare-people-with-disabilities-face-complex-choices"">have some discretion</a> about which specific therapies they'll cover within each category of benefit. So it's very important to study the plans carefully to make sure it is offering any specific benefits you may need.<br><br>There's a cap on how much you pay out-of-pocket for medical services each year. That cap is $6,350 for individual policies and $12,700 for family plans in 2014. Your regular monthly premiums do not count toward the cap.","Exchanges,Basics",Exchanges,Basics,,"exchanges,basics"
What is a health insurance exchange?,"It's an <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/"">online marketplace</a> where individuals and small employers can shop for insurance coverage. Enrollment began Oct. 1 for policies that will go into effect on Jan. 1. The exchanges will also help people find out if they are eligible for <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/how-can-i-save-money-on-marketplace-coverage/"">federal subsidies</a> to help cover the cost of coverage or if they are eligible for Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor.","Exchanges,Basics",Exchanges,Basics,,"exchanges,basics"
"What's this about Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum plans?","Plans are divided into <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/how-do-i-choose-marketplace-insurance/"">four different types</a> – bronze, silver, gold and platinum – varying based on the size of their deductibles, copayments and other consumer costs. The bronze plan pays for 60 percent of medical costs; the platinum, 90 percent. Premiums (monthly payments) are highest and deductibles (the amount you have to pay before the insurnace kicks in) the lowest for platinum plans. Bronze plans generally have deductibles in the thousands of dollars; $5,000 and $10,000 deductibles are not unusual for bronze plans. Within each tier, the amount you pay for deductibles, copayments and co-insurance may vary from company to company and even from plan to plan within companies.<br><br>
<p>No matter which plan you choose, the 10 essential benefits remain the same. There is also the option to purchase catastrophic insurance — low cost plans that cover minimal services but provide a safety net in the event of an accident or serious illness. But those plans do not come with subsidies.<br><br>
<p>People up to age 30 will have the option of buying <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-the-different-types-of-health-insurance/"">a catastrophic plan</a> that will cover only minimal services until they meet a deductible of roughly $6,400. The premium is usually much lower than the other plans. After the deductible is met, the plan covers the 10 essential health benefits — a kind of ""safety net"" coverage in case you have an accident or serious illness, according to the <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-the-different-types-of-health-insurance/"">Healthcare.gov website</a>. Catastrophic plans usually do not provide coverage for services like prescription drugs or shots. And there are other limits.","Exchanges,Basics",Exchanges,Basics,,"exchanges,basics"
When can I shop at my exchange?,"You can enroll--and avoid paying any penalty--until March 31, 2014. If you sign up and pay your premium between Dec. 16 and Jan. 15, 2014, coverage starts on February 1.<br><br>

Jan. 16 - Feb. 15: coverage begins March 1.<br><br>

Feb. 16 - March 15: coverage begins April 1<br><br>

March 16 - 31: coverage begins May 1.<br><br>

Generally, people will be able to enroll in or change plans once a year during an annual open enrollment period. This first year, that period is unusually long.

Do small businesses have to shop at the exchanges to cover employees?,"Employers with fewer than 50 workers are not required to buy health insurance for their employees. Many small business do offer health care as a benefit, however, and for them, the insurance exchanges represent a new option in terms of where to shop.","Exchanges,Businesses",Exchanges,Businesses,,"exchanges,businesses"
Will COBRA rates increase?,"COBRA is a transitional arrangement that allows you to stay on a former employer's health insurance for up to 18 months after you've stopped working for them. It's expensive: You pay the entire premium — including any share the employer had previously paid on your behalf — plus a 2 percent administrative fee.<br><br>

Whether your COBRA rate will go up depends entirely on what happens with your former employer's health insurance plans. If their rates go up, so will yours. You'll likely see a higher increase than your former co-workers, however. That's because their premiums may be subsidized by the employer, whereas yours are not.<br><br>

Many people who might have used COBRA will find that <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/17/223341729/laid-off-and-looking-for-health-insurance-beware-of-cobra"" target=""_self"">buying insurance on the exchanges is cheaper</a>. But pay close attention to when the enrollment period for the exchanges are. People who enroll in COBRA and later decide they want to switch to an exchange plan generally won't be allowed to do so until the exchange's next annual open enrollment period. An exception would be if they exhaust their COBRA coverage.","Employers,Cobra",Employers,COBRA,223341729,"employers,cobra"

How do I claim the subsidy?,"If you qualify for a subsidy to pay your premiums, you can choose to either have the credit sent directly to the insurer or pay the whole premium up front and claim the credit later on your taxes.<br><br>

If you qualify for help with deductibles and co-payments, that subsidy will be sent directly to the insurer, and you won't have to pay as much out-of-pocket.","Exchanges,Costs",Exchanges,Costs,243584170,"exchanges,costs"
How much will insurance cost me on the exchange?,"It depends on several factors, including your income, the state in which you live, your age, whether you smoke or not and your family size, among other factors. You could end up paying very little or nothing at all if your income falls within a certain range. If you do not qualify for a subsidy, coverage could be quite expensive — well over $1,000 a month in some cases. But this may still be lower than what you are paying now, if you have an individual policy.<br><br>

There are caveats. One is that the cheaper plans come with big deductibles and lots of other out-of-pocket costs. Now, if you don't think you're going to have much in the way of medical expenses, that may be fine. But people should be aware that if they buy a plan that only costs $40 or $50 a month, they may have a $5,000 or $10,000 deductible before the plan starts paying benefits.<br><br>

The other is that some of these less expensive plans come with very limited lists of doctors and hospitals. So if you have a particular doctor or hospital you know you want to use, you should check that before you sign up.","Exchanges,Costs",Exchanges,Costs,243584170,"exchanges,costs"
I have read that the subsidy can only be applied to a Silver plan. Is that true?,"It depends on which subsidy you're talking about.<br><br>
One subsidy is to help pay your monthly premiums. If you qualify for that subsidy (<a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/30/226456791/how-much-will-obamacare-cost-me-try-our-calculator"" target=""_self"">use our calculator</a>), you can apply it toward the purchase of any plan — bronze, silver, gold or platinum. Where silver plans come into play here is in calculating the amount of your subsidy: It's based on the price of the second-lowest silver plan in your area. If you choose a gold or platinum plan, you'll still get the subsidy. But those plans have higher monthly premiums and you'll have to make up the difference. Likewise, if you choose a bronze plan, you'll get the subsidy and your monthly premiums will be less.<br><br>
There's another subsidy to be had in the form of help with deductibles and co-payments. To qualify for that subsidy, you do have to choose a silver plan. Your income also has to fall below $28,725 for an individual or $58,875 for a family of four.","Exchanges,Costs",Exchanges,Costs,243584170,"exchanges,costs"

What if I can't afford the premiums?,"The health law provides fairly generous subsidies for many people, effectively lowering their monthly premiums. The subsidies are on a sliding-scale, though, so they become less generous as your income grows. If your income is income between 100 percent of the <a href=""http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/13poverty.cfm"">federal poverty level</a> ($11,490 for an individual) and 400 percent ($45,960), you can get some help paying for premiums. A family of four can get a subsidy, although just a small one, with income up to $94,200.<br><br>

Some people also can get help with deductibles and co-payments. To qualify, your income has to be less than 2.5 times the poverty level ($28,725 for an individual or $58,875 for a family of four). You also have to choose a so-called silver plan. That's the second lowest cost of the four levels of coverage that will be available — bronze, silver, gold and platinum.<br><br>

Subsidy amounts are calculated based on your modified adjusted gross income, a figure you can find on your annual tax return by <a href=""http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1601/~/calculation-of-modified-adjusted-gross-income-(magi)"">adding lines 8b and 37 on IRS form 1040</a>.

If they don't collect, the health care provider would have to eat the cost.

What if I guess wrong on what my income will be for next year?,"If your income increases during the year, notify the exchange promptly so that you can avoid having to pay back the subsidy.

In states that decided not to participate in the Medicaid expansion, the rules are different and vary from state to state. About half of the states opted out of the Medicaid expansion, which is something that the U.S. Supreme Court gave them permission to do. In those states, the income cutoff to be eligible for Medicaid is generally much lower than what was set in the Affordable Care Act, so fewer people will qualify.

"If your employer currently offers insurance, did you have to go with your employer's insurance, or were you actually able to select a plan outside of that?","This is one of the most frequently asked questions about the health law. And the answer is, it depends. Pretty much anyone can drop employment-based insurance and buy a policy on the exchange instead. But in most cases you won't be eligible for a subsidy, no matter how low your income is.</br>

That's because the members of Congress who wrote the law didn't want people rushing out of their employment-based plans to the exchanges and getting federal subsidies, which would have run up the law's price tag. So for most people it won't make a lot of economic sense to switch — most employers pay at least some, and usually a lot, of the cost of employee health insurance if they offer it.</br>

Insurers generally offer a variety of types of plans, including familiar models like PPOs and HMOs.

How does it work to shop for insurance from an exchange?,"In theory, you can do it all or most of it online. You go to healthcare.gov or to your state-run exchange, if there is one, and create an account. You provide some basic information, like where you live and how old you are and you'll get a list of plans available in your area. If you provide income information, you'll be able to get an estimate of whether you'll eligible for federal help paying for insurance or whether you might qualify for Medicaid.<br><br>

The exchange will offer a list of health plans and their premiums and out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and co-payments. If you decide to buy one of those plans, in most cases, you will be directed to the insurer's Web site to make the payment. Some plans or insurance companies may require a phone call to set up payment. In some jurisdictions, consumers will make their first premium payment to the exchange and then further monthly payments to the insurer.<br><br>

If your income makes you eligible for a tax credit subsidy, it will be applied upfront to the monthly premium payment. You won't have to wait until you file your taxes in 2015 to get the credit.<br><br>

"What happens if I sign up for a plan on the health exchange and gets federal subsidies to help pay the premiums, but then don't end up earning enough and should have been on Medicaid instead. Will she be expected to pay those subsidies back?","No. The way the law was written, it was expected that most people with low incomes would be <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/10/23/239833838/states-refusal-to-expand-medicaid-may-leave-millions-uninsured"">enrolled in the Medicaid program</a>.

If not, you may fall into the gap where there is no program for you.<br>

The catch is that you have to estimate your income in advance. So you may overestimate your income, buy coverage and get subsidies, and then discover when tax time comes that you weren't actually eligible, after all, because you earned too little. Experts assure us that this possibility has been taken into account, and you won't be punished or thrown into jail or even asked to pay back the subsidies in those situations.<br>

On the other hand, if you underestimate your income and get subsidies, then end up earning more, come tax time the following year you will <a href=""http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/programs/health-economics/projects/CalSIM/Documents/SubsidyRepaymentCPAC1.pdf"">be expected to pay back subsidies</a> you weren't eligible for.

The help is reduced for people who make more money, and is cut off altogether at 400 percent of the poverty level, which is <a href=""http://www.familiesusa.org/resources/tools-for-advocates/guides/federal-poverty-guidelines.html"">$45,960</a>.</br>

Bottom line: If you're an individual making up to $45,950, you should be eligible for at least a bit of a subsidy.</br>

Now, there may be cases where someone doesn't qualify for help, or does qualify for help but still can't afford the premium. And those people won't be required to have insurance. The law says if you would have to spend more than <a href=""http://kff.org/infographic/the-requirement-to-buy-coverage-under-the-affordable-care-act/"">8 percent of your income on insurance</a>, you are excused from having to pay any penalty for not buying insurance. There are <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-Sheets/2013-Fact-Sheets-Items/2013-06-26.html?DLPage=1&amp;DLSort=0&amp;DLSortDir=descending"">several other types of people who are excused</a>. And you can always seek a hardship exception if you think you truly can't afford coverage.</br>

How much will the premiums be? That information is just starting to come in from some of the states. It will depend on a lot of factors — where you live, how old you are, whether you want to pay a higher premium and have a lower deductible, or pay a lower premium and have a higher deductible. And, of course, whether you're eligible for a subsidy. But from what we've seen so far, premiums for the standard ""silver plan"" seem to be averaging <a href=""http://www.avalerehealth.net/news/spotlight/20130619_Avalere_Exchange_Rate_Analysis.pdf"">between $200 and $400 a month</a> for an individual, without subsidies.</br>",Penalties,Penalties,,243584170,penalties
"If you are self-employed, is there a cap to how much you can make to use the Affordable Care Act insurance?","No. There's no upper limit to how much you can earn and still be able to buy health insurance on the exchange. But there is an upper limit on how much you can earn and qualify for a subsidy to help offset the costs. That upper limit is 400 percent of the <a href=""http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/13poverty.cfm"">federal poverty level</a> — about $46,000 in <a href=""http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/healthcare/MAGI_summary13.pdf"">modified adjusted gross income</a> for an individual and about $94,000 for a family of four. If you earn less than those amounts, you can qualify a subsidy that will lower your premiums. Earn more than that, you'll have to pay full freight.",Self Employed,Self employed,,,self-employed
"Is it true that subsidies apply only to silver-level plans, and that if a person decides to purchase a lower-cost bronze plan, the subsidy cannot be applied?","That's actually not the case. But first let's back up a bit and explain what he's talking about. There are <a href=""http://www.healthpocket.com/affordable-care-act/metal-plans#.Un1i8ye9NuY"">four different levels of coverage</a> you can choose on the exchanges, and they're named for metals: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. Bronze plans have the lowest premiums but also the fewest benefits; platinum plans, the highest premiums and most generous benefits.</br>

People under age 30 have another option; a <a href=""https://www.aamc.org/advocacy/washhigh/highlights2013/330422/cmsissuesfinalrulesrelatedtoexchangesandacamarketplacereforms.html"">basic plan</a> that covers just preventive services and three primary care visits before deductibles are met. But the plan also covers care for a catastrophic illness or injury.</br>

The confusion arises because the amount of subsidy someone gets is calculated based on the <a href=""http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7962-02.pdf"">silver plan</a>. But that subsidy can then be applied to any plan you want. For many people, that subsidy may be enough to get bronze-level coverage <a href=""http://www.healthbeatblog.com/category/zero-net-premiums/"">free</a>.</br>

But there's an exception to that, too. Some people will qualify for help with not just premium, but with deductibles and copays, too. That's for people with income under 2 1/2 times the poverty level, or about $23,000 for an individual. To get that extra help, you do have to buy a <a href=""http://www.acscan.org/pdf/healthcare/implementation/background/HealthReformPremiumCostSharingSubsidies.pdf"">silver-level plan</a>.",Subsidies,Subsidies,,243584170,subsidies
"What about part-time workers?
","Nothing in the Affordable Care Act says that employers have to cover part-time workers. The law defines part time as someone who works less than 30 hours a week.<br><br>
Some employers that have offered part-time workers minimal coverage, <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/10/04/229103233/part-time-workers-search-new-exchanges-for-health-insurance"">such as Trader Joe's and Home Depot</a>, have dropped it on the grounds that those workers can now find coverage through the insurance exchanges. Most workers in this situation will be pleased with the outcome. They'll likely find better coverage than what they had for less money.

Will my company stop offering coverage to my spouse and dependents?,"Some companies, including UPS, have decided to <a href=""http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2013/August/21/Insurance-For-Working-Spouses-At-UPS.aspx"">stop covering working spouses</a> if they have access to coverage at their own jobs. The health law does not require employers to cover spouses, but <a href=""http://www.towerswatson.com/en/Insights/IC-Types/Survey-Research-Results/2013/03/Towers-Watson-NBGH-Employer-Survey-on-Value-in-Purchasing-Health-Care"">surveys show</a> that only a minority of companies have implemented a ""spousal exclusion.""<br><br>

However, employers increasingly offer incentives to get spouses off their plans. They may charge workers extra if a covered spouse has access to other insurance, or they may pay bonuses when spouses are not on the company policy.<br><br>

Will my employer cut back on my insurance coverage?,"A number of employers have been overhauling the health benefits they offer employees, citing rising costs.<br><br>
There are two themes to what they are doing. In trying to control their own spending, employers often are shifting health costs to employees. So the average annual deductible for an individual — what consumers pay before insurance kicks in — nearly doubled in the past seven years, from $584 in 2006 to $1,135 this year, <a href=""http://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2013-section-7/"">according to</a> the Kaiser Family Foundation.<br><br>
