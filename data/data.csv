So I have to have health insurance?,"Yes, most people are required to have insurance as of Jan. 1, 2014, or else you will be liable for a tax penalty. That coverage can be supplied through your job (including COBRA or a retirement plan), public programs such as Medicare, Medicaid or the VA, or an individual policy that you purchase.

What is a health insurance exchange?,"It's an <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/"">online marketplace</a> where individuals and small employers can shop for insurance coverage.

How does it work to shop for insurance from an exchange?,"In theory, you can do all or most of it online. You go to HealthCare.gov or to your state-run exchange, if there is one, and create an account. You provide some basic information, like where you live and how old you are and you'll get a list of plans available in your area. If you provide income information, you'll be able to get an estimate of whether you'll be eligible for federal help paying for insurance or you might qualify for Medicaid.<br><br>

The exchange will offer a list of health plans and their premiums and out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and copayments. If you decide to buy one of those plans, in most cases, you will be directed to the insurer's website to make the payment. Some plans or insurance companies may require a phone call to set up payment. In some jurisdictions, consumers will make their first premium payment to the exchange and then further monthly payments to the insurer.<br><br>

If your income makes you eligible for a tax credit subsidy, it will be applied upfront to the monthly premium payment. You won't have to wait until you file your taxes in 2015 to get the credit.<br><br>

You can also fill out paper applications or apply over the phone.",Exchanges,Enrolling,
Can I keep my doctor?,"If you're shopping for a new policy on the insurance exchanges or are eligible for Medicaid, the answer is ""Maybe."" For private policies purchased through the exchange, it all depends on the list of doctors that the health plan considers ""in network."" If your doctor isn't in the plan's network, you're likely to pay a higher amount for co-insurance or a copayment. The number of doctors who take Medicaid is growing in states where the program is being expanded, but the number who take Medicaid is still limited in most areas.",Exchanges,Basics,

"What's this about Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum plans?","Plans are divided into <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/how-do-i-choose-marketplace-insurance/"">four different types</a> – Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum – varying based on the size of their deductibles, copayments and other consumer costs. The Bronze plan pays for 60 percent of medical costs; the Platinum, 90 percent. Premiums are highest and deductibles the lowest for Platinum plans. Bronze plans generally have deductibles in the thousands of dollars; $5,000 and $10,000 deductibles. Within each tier, the amount you pay for deductibles, copayments and coinsurance may vary from company to company and even from plan to plan within companies.<br><br>
<p>No matter which plan you choose, the 10 essential benefits remain the same.

Do small businesses have to shop at the exchanges to cover employees?,"Employers with fewer than 50 workers are not required to buy health insurance for their employees. Many small business do offer health care as a benefit, however, and for them, the insurance exchanges represent a new option in terms of where to shop.",Exchanges,Businesses,
Will COBRA rates increase?,"COBRA is a transitional arrangement that allows you to stay on a former employer's health insurance for up to 18 months after you've stopped working for the company. It's expensive: You pay the entire premium — including any share the employer had previously paid on your behalf — plus a 2 percent administrative fee.<br><br>

Whether your COBRA rate will go up depends entirely on what happens with your former employer's health insurance plans. If its rates go up, so will yours. You'll most likely see a higher increase than your former co-workers, however. That's because their premiums may be subsidized by the employer, whereas yours are not.<br><br>

How much will insurance cost me on the exchange?,"It depends on several factors, including your income, the state in which you live, your age, whether you smoke or not and your family size. You could end up paying very little or nothing at all if your income falls within a certain range.  If you don't qualify for a subsidy, from what we've seen so far, premiums for the standard ""Silver plan"" seem to be averaging <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.avalerehealth.net/news/spotlight/20130619_Avalere_Exchange_Rate_Analysis.pdf"">between $200 and $400 a month</a> for an individual.</br> Depending on your circumstances and which plan you choose, coverage could be quite expensive — well over $1,000 a month in some cases. But this may still be lower than what you are paying now, if you have an individual policy.<br><br>

There are caveats. One is that the cheaper plans come with big deductibles and lots of other out-of-pocket costs. Now, if you don't think you're going to have much in the way of medical expenses, that may be fine. But people should be aware that if they buy a plan that costs only $40 or $50 a month, they may have a $5,000 or $10,000 deductible before the plan starts paying benefits.<br><br>

The other is that some of these less expensive plans come with very limited lists of doctors and hospitals. So if you have a particular doctor or hospital you know you want to use, you should check that before you sign up.",Exchanges,Costs,243584170
I have read that the subsidy can only be applied to a Silver plan. Is that true?,"It depends on which subsidy you're talking about.<br><br>
One subsidy is to help pay your monthly premiums. If you qualify for that subsidy (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/30/226456791/how-much-will-obamacare-cost-me-try-our-calculator"" target=""_self"">use our calculator</a>), you can apply it toward the purchase of any plan — Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum. Where Silver plans come into play here is in calculating the amount of your subsidy: It's based on the price of the second-lowest Silver plan in your area. If you choose a Gold or Platinum plan, you'll still get the subsidy. But those plans have higher monthly premiums and you'll have to make up the difference. Likewise, if you choose a Bronze plan, you'll get the subsidy and your monthly premiums will be less.<br><br>
There's another subsidy to be had in the form of help with deductibles and copayments. To qualify for that subsidy, you do have to choose a Silver plan. Your income also has to fall below $28,725 for an individual or $58,875 for a family of four.",Exchanges,Costs,243584170

What if I can't afford the premiums?,"The health law provides fairly generous subsidies for many people, effectively lowering their monthly premiums.

A family of four can get a subsidy, although just a small one, with income up to $94,200.<br><br>

Some people also can get help with deductibles and copayments. To qualify, your income has to be less than 2.5 times the poverty level ($28,725 for an individual or $58,875 for a family of four). You also have to choose a so-called Silver plan. That's the second lowest cost of the four levels of coverage that will be available — Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.<br><br>

Do I have to buy insurance on an exchange?,"No. You can get insurance through traditional methods. You may want to use a broker or buy insurance independently through one of several online websites.

The exchanges are designed for two major groups of people: those who don't have insurance now, and those who currently purchase their own insurance, meaning they don't get it through an employer.<br><br>

If you have insurance at your job or through a public program like Medicare, Medicaid or the VA, you don't need to pay attention to the exchanges unless you lose that coverage for some reason. If you have insurance through your employer, you can shop for and buy insurance on an exchange if you like, but you probably won't qualify for a subsidy or tax credit.

About half of the states opted out of the Medicaid expansion, which is something that the U.S. Supreme Court gave them permission to do.

"If your employer currently offers insurance, do you have to use that insurance, or do you have the option of selecting another plan?","This is one of the most frequently asked questions about the health law. And the answer is, it depends. Pretty much anyone can drop employment-based insurance and buy a policy on the exchange instead. But in most cases you won't be eligible for a subsidy, no matter how low your income is.</br>

That's because the members of Congress who wrote the law didn't want people rushing out of their employment-based plans to the exchanges and getting federal subsidies. That would have run up the law's price tag considerably. For most people, though, it won't make a lot of economic sense to switch.

","Not right now. At the moment you're required to sign up in the exchange for the state that matches your mailing address.

So far, though, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/out-of-state-health-insurance-purchases.aspx"">only seven states</a> have passed legislation that would allow their health insurance policies to be sold across state lines, and none of those states have taken the necessary steps to make this happen.

The law says if you would have to spend more than <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://kff.org/infographic/the-requirement-to-buy-coverage-under-the-affordable-care-act/"">8 percent of your income on insurance</a>, you are excused from having to pay any penalty for not buying it.

How much will the premiums be? That information is just starting to come in from some of the states. It will depend on a lot of factors — where you live, how old you are, whether you want to pay a higher premium and have a lower deductible, or pay a lower premium and have a higher deductible. And, of course, whether you're eligible for a subsidy. But from what we've seen so far, premiums for the standard Silver plan seem to be averaging <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.avalerehealth.net/news/spotlight/20130619_Avalere_Exchange_Rate_Analysis.pdf"">between $200 and $400 a month</a> for an individual, without subsidies.</br>",Penalties,Basics,243584170
"If you are self-employed, is there a cap to how much you can make to use the Affordable Care Act insurance?","No. There's no upper limit to how much you can earn and still be able to buy health insurance on the exchange.

"Is it true that subsidies apply only to Silver-level plans, and that if a person decides to purchase a lower-cost Bronze plan, the subsidy cannot be applied?","That's actually not the case. But first let's back up a bit and explain the question. There are <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.healthpocket.com/affordable-care-act/metal-plans#.Un1i8ye9NuY"">four different levels of coverage</a> you can choose on the exchanges, and they're named for metals: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.

People under age 30 have another option: a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.aamc.org/advocacy/washhigh/highlights2013/330422/cmsissuesfinalrulesrelatedtoexchangesandacamarketplacereforms.html"">basic plan</a> that covers just preventive services and three primary care visits before deductibles are met. But the plan also covers care for a catastrophic illness or injury.</br>

The confusion arises because the amount of subsidy someone gets is calculated based on the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7962-02.pdf"">Silver plan</a>. But that subsidy can then be applied to any plan you want.

Of course, there's an exception to that, too. Some people will qualify for help with not just premium but deductibles and copays as well.
