So I have to have health insurance?,"Yes, just about everyone is required to have insurance as of Jan. 1, 2014, or else they'll be liable for a tax penalty. That coverage can be supplied through your job (including COBRA or a retirement plan), public programs such as Medicare, Medicaid or the VA, or an individual policy that you purchase.

What is a health insurance exchange?,"It's an <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/"">online marketplace</a> where individuals and small employers can shop for insurance coverage. Enrollment began Oct. 1 for policies that will go into effect on Jan. 1. The exchanges will also help people find out if they are eligible for <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/how-can-i-save-money-on-marketplace-coverage/"">federal subsidies</a> to help cover the cost of coverage or if they are eligible for Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor.",Exchanges,Basics,
How does it work to shop for insurance from an exchange?,"In theory, you can do it all or most of it online. You go to healthcare.gov or to your state-run exchange, if there is one, and create an account. You provide some basic information, like where you live and how old you are and you'll get a list of plans available in your area. If you provide income information, you'll be able to get an estimate of whether you'll eligible for federal help paying for insurance or whether you might qualify for Medicaid.<br><br>

The exchange will offer a list of health plans and their premiums and out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and co-payments. If you decide to buy one of those plans, in most cases, you will be directed to the insurer's Web site to make the payment. Some plans or insurance companies may require a phone call to set up payment. In some jurisdictions, consumers will make their first premium payment to the exchange and then further monthly payments to the insurer.<br><br>

If your income makes you eligible for a tax credit subsidy, it will be applied upfront to the monthly premium payment. You won't have to wait until you file your taxes in 2015 to get the credit.<br><br>

You can also fill out paper applications or apply over the phone.",Exchanges,Enrolling,
Can I keep my doctor?,"If you're shopping for a new policy on the insurance exchanges or are eligible for Medicaid, the answer is ""Maybe."" For private policies purchased through the exchange, it all depends on the list of doctors that the health plan considers 'in network.' If your doctor isn't in the plan's network, you'll likely pay a higher amount for co-insurance or copayment. The number of doctors who take Medicaid is growing in states where the program is being expanded, but the number of doctors who take Medicaid is still limited in most areas.",Exchanges,Basics,
"If my employer (or former employer, if I'm retired) offers me insurance, can I shop on the exchange to get a better deal?","Even if your employer offers coverage, you can opt to buy a plan on the exchange. However, you may not be eligible for a subsidy.",Exchanges,Basics,243584170
What health services are covered?,"Each plan offered has to cover 10 ""essential health benefits."" These include: <ol><li>Ambulatory patient services</li>
<li>Emergency services</li>
<li>Hospitalization</li>
<li>Maternity and newborn care</li>

<li>Laboratory services</li>
<li>Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management</li>
<li>Pediatric services, including oral (dental) and vision care</li></ol>
<br>It's important to keep in mind that the insurer does <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/08/15/210481505/obamacare-people-with-disabilities-face-complex-choices"">have some discretion</a> about which specific therapies they'll cover within each category of benefit.

That cap is $6,350 for individual policies and $12,700 for family plans in 2014. Your regular monthly premiums do not count toward the cap.",Exchanges,Basics,
How do I claim the subsidy?,"If you qualify for a subsidy to pay your premiums, you can choose to either have the credit sent directly to the insurer or pay the whole premium up front and claim the credit later on your taxes.<br><br>

If you qualify for help with deductibles and co-payments, that subsidy will be sent directly to the insurer, and you won't have to pay as much out-of-pocket.",Exchanges,Costs,243584170
"What's this about Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum plans?","Plans are divided into <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/how-do-i-choose-marketplace-insurance/"">four different types</a> – bronze, silver, gold and platinum – varying based on the size of their deductibles, copayments and other consumer costs. The bronze plan pays for 60 percent of medical costs; the platinum, 90 percent. Premiums  are highest and deductibles the lowest for platinum plans. Bronze plans generally have deductibles in the thousands of dollars; $5,000 and $10,000 deductibles are not unusual for bronze plans. Within each tier, the amount you pay for deductibles, copayments and co-insurance may vary from company to company and even from plan to plan within companies.<br><br>
<p>No matter which plan you choose, the 10 essential benefits remain the same. There is also the option to purchase catastrophic insurance — low cost plans that cover minimal services but provide a safety net in the event of an accident or serious illness. But those plans do not come with subsidies.<br><br>
<p>People up to age 30 will have the option of buying <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-the-different-types-of-health-insurance/"">a catastrophic plan</a> that will cover only minimal services until they meet a deductible of roughly $6,400. The premium is usually much lower than the other plans. After the deductible is met, the plan covers the 10 essential health benefits — a kind of ""safety net"" coverage in case you have an accident or serious illness, according to the <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-the-different-types-of-health-insurance/"">Healthcare.gov website</a>.

Do small businesses have to shop at the exchanges to cover employees?,"Employers with fewer than 50 workers are not required to buy health insurance for their employees. Many small business do offer health care as a benefit, however, and for them, the insurance exchanges represent a new option in terms of where to shop.",Exchanges,Businesses,
Will COBRA rates increase?,"COBRA is a transitional arrangement that allows you to stay on a former employer's health insurance for up to 18 months after you've stopped working for them. It's expensive: You pay the entire premium — including any share the employer had previously paid on your behalf — plus a 2 percent administrative fee.<br><br>

Whether your COBRA rate will go up depends entirely on what happens with your former employer's health insurance plans. If their rates go up, so will yours. You'll likely see a higher increase than your former co-workers, however. That's because their premiums may be subsidized by the employer, whereas yours are not.<br><br>

Many people who might have used COBRA will find that <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/17/223341729/laid-off-and-looking-for-health-insurance-beware-of-cobra"" target=""_self"">buying insurance on the exchanges is cheaper</a>. But pay close attention to when the enrollment period for the exchanges are. People who enroll in COBRA and later decide they want to switch to an exchange plan generally won't be allowed to do so until the exchange's next annual open enrollment period. An exception would be if they exhaust their COBRA coverage.",Employers,COBRA,223341729

How much will insurance cost me on the exchange?,"It depends on several factors, including your income, the state in which you live, your age, whether you smoke or not and your family size. You could end up paying very little or nothing at all if your income falls within a certain range.  If you don't qualify for a subsidy, from what we've seen so far, premiums for the standard ""silver plan"" seem to be averaging <a href=""http://www.avalerehealth.net/news/spotlight/20130619_Avalere_Exchange_Rate_Analysis.pdf"">between $200 and $400 a month</a> for an individual.</br> Depending on your circumstances and what plan you choose, coverage could be quite expensive — well over $1,000 a month in some cases. But this may still be lower than what you are paying now, if you have an individual policy.<br><br>

There are caveats. One is that the cheaper plans come with big deductibles and lots of other out-of-pocket costs. Now, if you don't think you're going to have much in the way of medical expenses, that may be fine. But people should be aware that if they buy a plan that only costs $40 or $50 a month, they may have a $5,000 or $10,000 deductible before the plan starts paying benefits.<br><br>

The other is that some of these less expensive plans come with very limited lists of doctors and hospitals. So if you have a particular doctor or hospital you know you want to use, you should check that before you sign up.",Exchanges,Costs,243584170
I have read that the subsidy can only be applied to a Silver plan. Is that true?,"It depends on which subsidy you're talking about.<br><br>
One subsidy is to help pay your monthly premiums. If you qualify for that subsidy (<a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/30/226456791/how-much-will-obamacare-cost-me-try-our-calculator"" target=""_self"">use our calculator</a>), you can apply it toward the purchase of any plan — bronze, silver, gold or platinum. Where silver plans come into play here is in calculating the amount of your subsidy: It's based on the price of the second-lowest silver plan in your area. If you choose a gold or platinum plan, you'll still get the subsidy. But those plans have higher monthly premiums and you'll have to make up the difference. Likewise, if you choose a bronze plan, you'll get the subsidy and your monthly premiums will be less.<br><br>
There's another subsidy to be had in the form of help with deductibles and co-payments. To qualify for that subsidy, you do have to choose a silver plan. Your income also has to fall below $28,725 for an individual or $58,875 for a family of four.",Exchanges,Costs,243584170

"If I am sick and unable to work and have no income, can I get a plan on an exchange for free?","<p>If you are disabled and have no income, you most likely won't be shopping for insurance on the exchanges.

What if I can't afford the premiums?,"The health law provides fairly generous subsidies for many people, effectively lowering their monthly premiums. The subsidies are on a sliding scale, though, so they become less generous as your income grows. If your income is between 100 percent of the <a href=""http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/13poverty.cfm"">federal poverty level</a> ($11,490 for an individual) and 400 percent ($45,960), you can get some help paying for premiums. A family of four can get a subsidy, although just a small one, with income up to $94,200.<br><br>

Some people also can get help with deductibles and co-payments. To qualify, your income has to be less than 2.5 times the poverty level ($28,725 for an individual or $58,875 for a family of four). You also have to choose a so-called silver plan. That's the second lowest cost of the four levels of coverage that will be available — bronze, silver, gold and platinum.<br><br>

Subsidy amounts are calculated based on your modified adjusted gross income, a figure you can find on your annual tax return by <a href=""http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1601/~/calculation-of-modified-adjusted-gross-income-(magi)"">adding lines 8b and 37 on IRS form 1040</a>.

What if I don't have health insurance and I get sick or have to go to the emergency room?,"If you don't have insurance, you'll get a bill, just as it's always been. If you can't pay, the hospital or other health care provider will still try to collect from you, although there are some provisions of the law aimed at <a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2012/07/02/irs-to-tax-exempt-hospitals-go-easier-on-medical-debt-collection/"">discouraging some of the most aggressive collection tactics</a> that have been used in the past. If they don't collect, the health care provider would have to eat the cost. That's why hospitals have been so anxious to have most people covered by insurance, so that they could stop providing so much free care to people who can't pay.",Penalties,Costs,
What if I'm wrong about my estimated income for next year?,"If your income increases during the year, notify the exchange promptly so that you can avoid having to pay back the subsidy. On the other hand, if your income goes down, you could be eligible for a bigger subsidy. Either way it's important to notify the exchange if your income changes.

Do I have to buy insurance on an exchange?,"Some people do, but definitely not everyone. These exchanges are for two major groups of people: Those who don't have insurance now, and those who currently purchase their own insurance, meaning they don't get it through an employer.<br><br>

In states that decided not to participate in the Medicaid expansion, the rules are different and vary from state to state. About half of the states opted out of the Medicaid expansion, which is something that the U.S. Supreme Court gave them permission to do. In those states, the income cutoff to be eligible for Medicaid is generally much lower than what was set in the Affordable Care Act, so fewer people will qualify.

One is if your employer's insurance plan is on the skimpy side and doesn't pay at least 60 percent of your typical health expenses. The second is if your coverage — <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/30/obamacare-glitch-priced-out-of-health-care_n_2585695.html"">not your family's coverage, but your coverage</a> — costs more than 9.5 percent of your family income.",Exchanges,Employers,
Do the exchanges have a good selection of plans to choose from?,"The number of plans that you can choose from varies widely. In some states, only a couple of insurers are offering policies though the marketplace, while in others there may be a dozen or more. Even within a state, there will be differences in the number of plans available in different areas. Insurers generally offer a variety of types of plans, including familiar models like PPOs and HMOs.

How does it work to shop for insurance from an exchange?,"In theory, you can do all or most of it online. You go to healthcare.gov or to your state-run exchange, if there is one, and create an account. (If you aren't sure, healthcare.gov will let you know if your state has its own exchange.) You provide some basic information, like where you live and how old you are and you'll get a list of plans available in your area. If you provide income information, you'll be able to get an estimate of whether you'll be eligible for a subsidy or whether you might qualify for Medicaid.<br><br>

The exchange will offer a list of health plans and their premiums and out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and co-payments. If you decide to buy one of those plans, in most cases, you will be directed to the insurer's Web site to make the payment. Some plans or insurance companies may require a phone call to set up payment. In some jurisdictions, consumers will make their first premium payment to the exchange and then further monthly payments to the insurer.<br><br>

If your income makes you eligible for a tax credit subsidy, it will be applied upfront to the monthly premium payment. You won't have to wait until you file your taxes in 2015 to get the credit.<br><br>

You can also fill out paper applications or apply over the phone.",Exchanges,Enrolling,
When can I shop at my exchange?,"You can enroll--and avoid paying any penalty--until March 31, 2014. If you sign up and pay your premium between Dec. 16 and Jan. 15, 2014, coverage starts on February 1.<br><br>

Jan. 16 - Feb. 15: coverage begins March 1.<br><br>

Feb. 16 - March 15: coverage begins April 1<br><br>

March 16 - 31: coverage begins May 1.<br><br>  For coverage starting in 2014, the Open Enrollment Period is October 1, 2013–March 31, 2014. <br>
For coverage starting in 2015, the Open Enrollment Period is November 15, 2014–January 15, 2015.
<br>

Generally, people will be able to enroll in or change plans once a year during an annual open enrollment period. This first year, that period is unusually long. In subsequent years, the time period is supposed to be shorter, running from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7.<br><br>",Exchanges,Basics,
What if I need help with signing up?,"The federal government has set up call centers to answer questions from people in states using the federal exchanges. That phone number is 1-800-318-2596. States running their own exchanges also have call centers.

Most states have also trained people called ""assisters"" and ""navigators"" who can walk people through the process, although in some states their training has been delayed. Contact information can be found on the exchange websites.",Exchanges,Enrolling,
What personal information will I have to give the exchange?,"You'll need to set up an account with your name, address and social security number. If you have an email address, you can provide that, too. The exchange will want to know about your marital status; the number of children under 18, birthdays of anyone who'll be covered; whether you smoke; financial information and citizenship status. The financial and citizenship information will be checked against records at the Internal Revenue Service and other government agencies.",Exchanges,Enrolling,
I'm having trouble signing up through HealthCare.gov. How can I get a paper application?,"There are several ways to get a paper application.

"What happens if I sign up for a plan on the health exchange and get federal subsidies to help pay the premiums, but then don't end up earning enough and should have been on Medicaid instead. Will she be expected to pay those subsidies back?","No. The way the law was written, it was expected that most people with low incomes would be <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/10/23/239833838/states-refusal-to-expand-medicaid-may-leave-millions-uninsured"">enrolled in the Medicaid program</a>. Because of that, if your income is under the poverty line — $11,490 for an individual this year — you're not eligible to buy coverage on the exchange. You could enroll in Medicaid instead, but only if your state is one of the 26 that are <a href=""http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/"">expanding the program</a>. If not, you may fall into the gap where there is no program for you.<br>

The catch is that you have to estimate your income in advance. So you may overestimate your income, buy coverage and get subsidies, and then discover when tax time comes that you weren't actually eligible, after all, because you earned too little. Experts assure us that this possibility has been taken into account, and you won't be punished or thrown into jail or even asked to pay back the subsidies in those situations.<br>

On the other hand, if you underestimate your income and get subsidies, then end up earning more, come tax time the following year you will <a href=""http://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/programs/health-economics/projects/CalSIM/Documents/SubsidyRepaymentCPAC1.pdf"">be expected to pay back subsidies</a> you weren't eligible for.

"I have insurance through my spouse's employer, but I might be able to get a better deal on the exchanges.

Do employers have to do anything different under the Affordable Care Act?,"Not right away.

Starting in 2015, employers with 50 or more workers have a responsibility — but no mandate — to offer employees health coverage.

There are no responsibilities for small employers with fewer than 50 workers.

"Is it true that subsidies apply only to silver-level plans, and that if a person decides to purchase a lower-cost bronze plan, the subsidy cannot be applied?","That's actually not the case.

The confusion arises because the amount of subsidy someone gets is calculated based on the <a href=""http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7962-02.pdf"">silver plan</a>. But that subsidy can then be applied to any plan you want. For many people, that subsidy may be enough to get bronze-level coverage <a href=""http://www.healthbeatblog.com/category/zero-net-premiums/"">free</a>.</br>

Of course, there's an exception to that, too. Some people will qualify for help with not just premium, but with deductibles and copays, as well. That's for people with income under 2 1/2 times the poverty level, or about $23,000 for an individual. To get that extra help, yes, you do have to buy a <a href=""http://www.acscan.org/pdf/healthcare/implementation/background/HealthReformPremiumCostSharingSubsidies.pdf"">silver-level plan</a>.",Subsidies,Basics,243584170
"What about part-time workers?
","Nothing in the Affordable Care Act says that employers have to cover part-time workers. The law defines part time as someone who works less than 30 hours a week.<br><br>
Some employers that have offered part-time workers minimal coverage, <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/10/04/229103233/part-time-workers-search-new-exchanges-for-health-insurance"">such as Trader Joe's and Home Depot</a>, have dropped it on the grounds that those workers can now find coverage through the insurance exchanges. Most workers in this situation will be pleased with the outcome. They'll likely find better coverage than what they had for less money. Although depending on the situation, some people may see their premiums go up.",Employers,Basics,
Will my company stop offering coverage to my spouse and dependents?,"Some companies, including UPS, have decided to <a href=""http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2013/August/21/Insurance-For-Working-Spouses-At-UPS.aspx"">stop covering working spouses</a> if they have access to coverage at their own jobs. The health law does not require employers to cover spouses, but <a href=""http://www.towerswatson.com/en/Insights/IC-Types/Survey-Research-Results/2013/03/Towers-Watson-NBGH-Employer-Survey-on-Value-in-Purchasing-Health-Care"">surveys show</a> that only a minority of companies have implemented a ""spousal exclusion.""<br><br>

However, employers increasingly offer incentives to get spouses off their plans. They may charge workers extra if a covered spouse has access to other insurance, or they may pay bonuses when spouses are not on the company policy.<br><br>

The health law does require employers who offer coverage to employees to also offer coverage to dependent children, or pay a penalty.",Employers,Basics,
Will my employer cut back on my insurance coverage?,"A number of employers have been overhauling the health benefits they offer employees, citing rising costs.<br><br>
There are two themes to what they are doing. In trying to control their own spending, employers are often shifting health costs to employees. So the average annual deductible for an individual — what consumers pay before insurance kicks in — nearly doubled in the past seven years, from $584 in 2006 to $1,135 this year, <a href=""http://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2013-section-7/"">according to</a> the Kaiser Family Foundation.<br><br>
But employers aren't just making workers pay more. They're also trying to make them think more about health-related expenses and behavior.<br><br>
Companies such as grocer Kroger Co. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/health/employers-test-plan-to-cap-medical-spending.html?ref=health&amp;_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all"">pay only a fixed amount</a> for particular drugs or procedures, giving patients incentive to shop around for the best price. <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-to-provide-employees-with-100-primary-health-care-coverage-new-wellness-rebate-67244012.html"">IBM started giving rebates</a> to workers who adopt healthy lifestyles.
